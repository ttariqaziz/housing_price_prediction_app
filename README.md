# Real Estate Price Predictor App using FLASK

Dataset is randomly generated using Python which is very similar to realistic data contains 'property_size' is in square feet, 'number_of_bedrooms' and 'number_of_bathrooms' are integers, and 'price' as target variable.

This project has 3 major parts:
1.	price_predictor_model.py - This contains code for our Machine Learning model to predict real estate prices.
2.	app.py - This contains Flask app that receives real estate details, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
3.	templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to enter real estate details to displays the predicted house prices.
